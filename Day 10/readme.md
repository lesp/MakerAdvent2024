## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Day 10 Sending a photo to ntfy.sh:**  
The goal today is to send a photo, captured using a Raspberry Pi Camera, to ntfy.sh using Node-RED.

Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/xtkpPKeXc8s) showing how the project works.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For today, you will need

![Raspberry Pi 5 and camera on desk](https://github.com/lesp/MakerAdvent2024/blob/main/Day%2010/Pi%205_and_Camera.jpg)

- Any model of Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi Camera connected
- Node-RED installed on your Raspberry Pi


Take a look at [day nine of Maker Advent](https://youtu.be/xc2CBeLp_8A) to get an idea on how Node-RED works with ntfy.sh

The JSON file inside this repository contains all of the nodes needed to create the project. All you need to do is copy the JSON code and import it into Node-RED. Here is a quick GIF to show how to do it.
